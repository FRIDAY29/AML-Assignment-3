## About the Project

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories. The goal is to build a neural network model that can accurately classify these images.

### Built With

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running example notebooks)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/fashion-mnist-classification.git
   cd fashion-mnist-classification
